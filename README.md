# Real-time-object-detection-project-using-YOLOv8-Ultralytics-
Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 in Python. Detects 80+ objects from webcam or video, displaying bounding boxes and labels. Supports Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook with inline display, adjustable confidence, and optional video output for fast, accurate, and interactive computer vision applications.

# How It Works:

-Input: Captures frames from a webcam or video file.
-Detection: Each frame is processed by the YOLOv8 model to detect objects in real time.
-Visualization: Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and class labels.
-Output: Users can view detections live and optionally save processed videos.

The project ensures fast and accurate detection while maintaining real-time performance, making it ideal for practical applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, or interactive AI experiments.

# Tech Stack:

-Programming Language: Python 3.8+
-Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch (via Ultralytics YOLOv8)
-Computer Vision Library: OpenCV
-Notebook Support: Jupyter Notebook (inline frame display)
-Optional Utilities: Pillow (for image handling)

# Key Features:

-Real-time detection of 80+ COCO objects
-Lightweight and fast inference with YOLOv8n
-Works in both script and notebook environments
-Configurable detection confidence, frame limits, and video output
-Extensible for custom datasets and object tracking
