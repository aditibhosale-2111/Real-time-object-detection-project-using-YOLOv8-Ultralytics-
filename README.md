# Real-time-object-detection-project-using-YOLOv8-Ultralytics-
Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 in Python. Detects 80+ objects from webcam or video, displaying bounding boxes and labels. Supports Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook with inline display, adjustable confidence, and optional video output for fast, accurate, and interactive computer vision applications.

# How It Works

-Input: Captures frames from a webcam or video file.
-Detection: Each frame is processed by the YOLOv8 model to detect objects in real time.
-Visualization: Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and class labels.
-Output: Users can view detections live and optionally save processed videos.

The project ensures fast and accurate detection while maintaining real-time performance, making it ideal for practical applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, or interactive AI experiments.
